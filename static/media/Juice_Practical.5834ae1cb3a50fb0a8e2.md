In this personally defined project, I set my focus on two older group project games. I tried to learn more about effects that contribute to "game juice", then identify applicable ones for these games and apply them. In the process, the practical part achieved less than what I would have liked, and I found out that my planning of activities did not hold up.

Other than research and implementation, I also had to organize people for playtests all remotely and survey them, since that was my intended measurement of progress. These activities piled up to strict implicit "deadlines" before the actual deadline. In turn, I crunched effect implementations to the minimal viable, for a total of 5-6 effects across the two games, and only simpler universal ones. Even though I was technically working on two games, most of the attention went to Furfare, respectively it is the most presentable.

&nbsp;

I learned that the best "juice" will easily differ by game genre and by the flair the base game already has. It could be argued that Furfare did not need simple effects such as screen shake and particles because it *already* had a lot of things going on. Conversely, Beans' Adventure (the other game) is a puzzle point-and-click, so it has limited interactivity moments for VFX; meanwhile, tailored improvements like hints would take exponentially much effort.
