In this assignment for "**Software Architecture**", the theory of design patterns was woven into a task to create a flexible and scalable tower defense game (most of the requirements are in an image below). In turn, after this assignment I can still easily add new towers, new enemies and enemy waves, and technically extend the game.

*However*, I would rather keep this as a prototype - it took me a long time to realize that I should design first and then implement, so that I was already forced to cut corners in making the game appealing, creating other entity variations that don't only differ by their stats, or polishing bugs and hardcoding. I do not mind the lack of visual appeal or the extra time spent to complete this, because it was one of my most valuable learning experiences. I hope to apply this knowledge later in "juicier" games!
