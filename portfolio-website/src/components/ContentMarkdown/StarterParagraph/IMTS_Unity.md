- **Creative puzzle representation**: The chosen puzzles all represent interaction with the real world (Unity scene) facilitated by our custom phone app. This required some design creativity to recreate in digital form and still present a plausible user experience.
- **Fast prototyping**: Usually I focus on code quality to the best of my abilities from the start of writing it, and may go out of my way to prevent problems I anticipate to happen later. This time, I prioritized time instead when writing code. In design I would also prioritize time where possible, but I still took some to adjust elements and avoid as many user inconveniences as I could think of. Overall, this makes me consider 2 weeks for a compound prototype with 4 games a good pace.
- **Adaptations to testing**: Even more rapid prototying, I fixed the most breaking issues after every test. This is not recommended in a usual testing process, but here I did it because such technical issues were harming the _concept evaluation_ part of the testing.
