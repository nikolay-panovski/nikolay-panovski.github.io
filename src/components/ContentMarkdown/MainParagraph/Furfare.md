For this project, we had relative freedom between one of several clients. Our team aligned the most with WIRWAR - a local gaming festival. Our assignment was therefore to create a competitive multiplayer game.

&nbsp;

We eventually stopped ourselves at a simple premise, close to Dodgeball - players throw balls at each other, however unlike Dodgeball, the balls can bounce for a while, and the unique factor is obstacles in the *middle* of the playfield. With this, we had prototypes early on, and the core gameplay stood their test. We used the time to build up on asset and level design, and invent some *variations* to the main mechanic, by introducing several projectile types, and later on - world events (global speed or scoring changes).

&nbsp;

We received various feedback from our teachers, and beyond giving us advice on handling team and technical issues, they pushed us to double down on the chaos that this game inherently produces - in turn, we increased the amount of effects on screen, and made certain props have physics - it became quite possible to barricade oneself with a toppled lamp! Although, who would want to miss an opportunity to attack? The areas and projectiles also evolved to fit our main theme of "cats vs dogs". Overall, we made the most out of our time, and the result may not be unique, but we observed how fun it is to play. For myself, this was a reward for a few long bugfixing nights in the last days of the project.

&nbsp;

For anyone interested, the game is up for you to brawl it off! (Just remember: playing alone is technically possible, but quite barren.)
