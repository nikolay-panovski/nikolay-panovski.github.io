This concept prototype is a catch-up for me to test several minigames ("quests") from a project for a larger experience with city games designed for _Nova Gorica (Slovenia) and Gorizia (Italy)_. I mainly wanted to find out whether the ideas are clear and fun to players.

&nbsp;

Although most of our ideas, in and outside of the prototype, featured strong real-life elements, here I chose Unity as the best possible representation, because we were missing almost all of the ideated equipment seen in the prototype and the final location was physically inaccessible to us. In hindsight, a creative paper prototype could have been worth trying too. Presented games are "TV static screen", "Memory puzzle with screens", "Morse code blinker", and "Puzzle pieces compound puzzle".
