This research is based on the module "**Advanced Tools**" at Saxion, which functions as a "technology preview". Out of the possible topics, I chose to investigate embedding languages since it sounded interesting enough and not too foreign to me (as opposed to topics such as Extended Reality or rendering optimizations), also backed up by a little practice with Lua before this module.

Test measurements compare the performance of Lua and of JavaScript when embedded in C++, in the time aspect and over reading, writing and function execution operations. I also attempted to show memory measurements, but they were not reliable enough to treat as facts.

Please refer to [my wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/nikolay-panovski/TTT_EmbedInCPP/wiki) for a complete report with background, methodology and other considerations. A page can also be found there on how I got inspired to do the simple measurements based on item and stat functionality in Binding of Isaac.
