The study module "**Applied Research**" let us choose our own topic of interest to research, writing a white paper on it that brings awareness of the topic to peers. Following my (still layman) interest in "game feel" [(as explored in my personal practical project)](/item_pages/Practical%20Research:%20Game%20Juice), I set out to find the most important common problem in the different papers and sources I had already seen and discuss it.

&nbsp;

Ironically, I had difficulties defining my focus - I could colloquially explain the topic to peers in labs and casual chatter, but I could not advance this to a proper problem. Eventually, I turned this into my problem statement - "game feel" is a vague, holistic concept, that is much better understood by intuition than by formality. Research papers were either finding out as much, or focusing on very specific facets of games that *could* be analyzed by statistics.

&nbsp;

In my paper, I advocate for wider-spread awareness, verbalization and discussion on the topic of "game feel". I argue for benefits such as finding a common vocabulary for research and industry, and a potential better breakdown of the intuitive concepts to pass on from industry experts to newcomers and students. However, due to the very nature of the problem, I might have not found clear and persuasive enough words in my work. For particularly interested people, I recommend the more professionally written summary paper called "[Designing Game Feel: A Survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9399794)" (Pichlmair & Johansen, 2022).
