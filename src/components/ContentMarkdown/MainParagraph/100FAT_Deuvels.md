This installation minigame is part of a series of 3 digitalized games representing various steps of building a ship. We did this for the newly opened Reggehub at Enter, our clients being an organization founded around a specific type of boat for the region. The Reggehub would serve as an interactive educational center for visitors, where they can see real-life-sized boats and then "participate" on their own via this room with digital installations.

For a project (initially) under time pressure and with relatively little interaction, this one was surprisingly fun. The hardships for me ended up hidden in UI design and interactions, rather than developing the base functionality and gameplay elements. During this project, I also needed to add a timer, and therefore had an opportunity to build a small library of classes related to timer usage. Their usefulness proportionate to the abstraction has grown outdated and calls for an overall redesign, but at the time of the project this feature was definitely at a stable state.
