The story here follows a boy who accidentally returns to medieval merchant times (the Hanze), and must explore and find three key items to return home. This almost-game experience seemed simple at first (chain some videos together with overlays - a flowchart is present in the Gallery below), but offered opportunities to play with nuances. Which UI elements should appear together at what point and with what effects applied? RFID near-distance scanning "just works", but how to order the readers and parse the input consistently? How much distance can still be scanned from? Many such questions were "extras" but informed my colleagues of how to tune the physical experience.

I had also planned user testing for this experience, but it was rendered impossible by the very delayed opening from the time at which I did this project. One year later, in late 2023, I managed to see it in full action on location. Based on a reported private visit beforehand - a primary school class of 12-13 chilren have played this with guidance, understanding the content and the interactions well; this has been a good addition to their lecture about barter systems and money.

I managed to personally see adults engaged in this experience as well. One round of the experience takes around 15 minutes, and even though a big part of it is watching, it seems to remain interesting until the end. On a technical level, things go smoothly.
