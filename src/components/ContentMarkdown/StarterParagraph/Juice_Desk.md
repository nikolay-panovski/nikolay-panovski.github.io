- **Differing and evolving perspectives**: I found the main interested parties in this topic to be researchers and practitioners. The former especially want to formalize "game feel" to be able to study it and draw conclusions for the latter to use, even if industry practice *can* survive without targeted effort towards better game feel. Over time perceptions also shift - initial calls to always "juice it up" have later been criticized and studied, and best effect found to be achieved in moderation.
- **Many aspects, many examples**: The easiest thing to identify as "good game feel" are specific effects that certain games have utilized well. These can be very diverse - polishing, physics, smooth input-output loop.
- **Relevancy for academic fields**: The implications of the "game feel" topic can stretch over to other interactive systems, Human-Computer Interaction in general.
- **People's interest**: Both when explaining "game feel" as a chosen topic in conversations and in the final discussion, I found an unexpected amount of interest (and understanding, after explaining with examples). This is another confirmation that there is value in mastering this craft, on top of the games known for it and commonly listed as examples.
