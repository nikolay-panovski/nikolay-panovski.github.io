- **OOP Design Patterns**: This project uses multiple behavioral patterns for decoupling communication between objects - Observer, Event Bus, State (FSM). I exercised the usage of these in other projects before using them successfully here, and learned their value especially when connecting UI to game elements - a good example here is Furfare, doubled in my other project where I tried to juice it.
- **The place and time for design patterns**: On my first attempt, I was approaching this with a mindset of "how do I take the list of possible and required design patterns and build my game?" Over time, I learned that this approach is backwards - design patterns are not a way to allow all kinds of design, a game still needs to be designed before I code for it.
- **UML Class Diagrams**: Formalizing what an object is made up of, without implementation intentions. Only basic experience, could definitely improve and use more often.
- **Not creational patterns**: One of the very first patterns I tried to use was Factory. This one I ultimately ended up not using in this project, and even nowadays I could take up another course to learn how and when to use it.
